PartialMap
==========

PartialMap is a small rake task that shows the heirarchy of your rails views and the partials they
call.  It can also take an optional directory argument, which will scope the tree to that view
directory.

Example
=======

% rake partial_map
...

% rake partial_map app/views/users
...
